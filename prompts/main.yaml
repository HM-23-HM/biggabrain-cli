expandSolution: |
  For each of the questions above, re-write the solution in a way that abides by the following rules:
  Write the solutions as if you're explaining the concept to a learner in a friendly, conversational way. 
  Imagine you're walking them through the steps, step-by-step, in a tone similar to Sal Khan from Khan Academy. 
  Be approachable, brief, and guide them as if you're teaching the concept during a tutoring session.
  Each step will be eventually converted to a photo, so make sure that each step in the solution is less than 60 words.
  Each step should begin with an <h3> tag. Each heading should begin with the numbered step, for example <h3>Step 1: ...</h3>. All math should abide by the KaTeX syntax outlined in the editing notes.
  Each advancement in the solution should be a new line.
  Return each question with all of its original fields, including the solution and section. Leave the other fields unchanged. However, the solution should be re-written to abide by the rules above.
  Ensure that the solution is consistent with the answer and the notes.
  Return the response as valid JSON.
  Don't include greetings like "Hey there!" or "Let's get started!" in the solution.
  Each line of the solution should be no more than 40 characters long. If it is longer, break it up into multiple lines within multiple <p> tags.
  Ensure that each sentence in the solution is started on a new line, so use a <p> tag for each sentence.
  Ensure that the solution abides by the following editing notes:
correctness: |
  Review each object for the accuracy of the answer to the question. 
  Then, review each object for consistency between the answer and the solution in substance not style. 
  If the answer is correct and consistent with the solution, then return the question prepended by the ✅ emoji. 
  If there are errors or inconsistencies between the answer and the solution, return question prepended by the ❌ emoji and the corrections in "corrections" in a JSON object. 
  Spend no more than 1 minute thinking about each question.

  Here are the questions:
correctTex: |
  Task:
  You are given JSON data that contains mathematical expressions. Your task is to ensure all mathematical expressions are properly enclosed in [tex]...[/tex] tags without modifying any other part of the text.

  Rules for Modifying [tex] Tags:

  1. CRITICAL: Any mathematical expressions indicated by LaTeX notation (especially with escape characters like \\) must be enclosed in [tex]...[/tex] tags, even if they currently appear without tags.
     However, When multiple mathematical expressions appear in sequence, they should be wrapped within a SINGLE pair of [tex] tags rather than multiple separate tags
  2. If an expression inside [tex]...[/tex] should be fully enclosed, move [tex] so that the entire mathematical expression is within the tags.
  3. If [tex] is incorrectly placed around non-math content (like plain text), remove the tags.
  4. Ensure that every complete mathematical expression remains within a single pair of [tex]...[/tex] tags.
  5. Maintain correct HTML structure and avoid breaking paragraph (<p>), heading (<h4>), and list elements.
  6. Do not alter non-mathematical content, spacing, punctuation, or any other part of the JSON structure.
  7. Return the other fields of the JSON object unchanged.
  8. Look specifically for LaTeX notation with backslashes (\\) outside of [tex] tags and enclose those in [tex]...[/tex] tags.
  9. Don't add unecessary parentheses, for example "\\(", "()" or "//)" around math notation.
  10. If the math contains multiline notation, for example "\\begin{equation*}" then use [texd] instead of [tex] tags.
  11. Process ALL fields in the JSON, including "question", "answer", "notes", "solution", "body", "objective", and "explanatory".

  Just give me back the modified objects. Don't give me back any code.
extractObjectives: |
  Please analyze this syllabus page and create an array of objects, 
  where each object represents a row with an objective and its corresponding explanatory note. 
  Each object should have two keys: 'objective' and 'explanatory'. 
  Convert all mathematical notation to KaTeX format and ensure proper JSON string escaping. 
  The output should look like:
  [
    {
    'objectiveIndex': 1,
    'objective': 'simplify algebraic fractions',
    'explanatory': 'The four basic operation on algebraic fractions'
    },
    {
    'objectiveIndex': 2,
    'objective': 'use the laws of indices to manipulate expressions with integral indices',
    'explanatory': 'For m ∈ Z, n ∈ Z:\n(i) x^m \\times x^n = x^{m+n}\n(ii) \\frac{x^m}{x^n} = x^{m-n}\n(iii) (x^m)^n = x^{mn}\n(iv) x^{-n} = \\frac{1}{x^n}'
    }
  ]
  Some objectives are comprised of sub-objectives. With each sub-objective prepended by a letter (like (a), (b), (c), etc.).
  For example:
  ```
  calculate:
  (a) discount;
  (b) sales tax;
  (c) profit; and,
  (d) loss;
  ```
  Treat such objectives as a single objective, but separate each sub-objective with a \n symbol like this:
  ```
  calculate:\n(a) discount;\n(b) sales tax;\n(c) profit; and, \n(d) loss;
  ```
  Don't call them sub-objectives.
  Please maintain the numbering from the source and ensure all mathematical expressions 
  are properly escaped for JSON strings. If an objective has no explanatory note, 
  or vice versa, include an empty string for that field. Start the numbering from 1.
generateLesson: |
  Develop a comprehensive lesson with the following objectives and ensure the following requirements are met:
  - Abide by the following editing notes
  - Some objectives are comprised of sub-objectives. With each sub-objective prepended by a letter (like (a), (b), (c), etc.).
    For example:
    ```
    {
    "objectiveIndex": 1,
    "objective": "calculate:\n(a) discount;\n(b) sales tax;\n(c) profit; and, \n(d) loss;",
    "explanatory": ""
    },
    ```
    Dedicate a separate lesson page for each sub-objective.
  - Provide simple examples after each concept is introduced to solidify understanding. These examples should also be in the body
  
  IMPORTANT ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS:
  1. Define all new terms and concepts clearly when they are first introduced. For example, if you mention "invertible" or any other technical term, explain what it means immediately.
  2. Ensure all examples are fully completed and carried through to their conclusion. Don't stop mid-example or leave calculations incomplete.
  3. Each lesson should have a proper beginning, middle, and end, with a clear flow of ideas.
  4. All mathematical formulas and expressions should be properly enclosed in [tex]...[/tex] tags.
  5. Use simple, straightforward language accessible to students encountering these concepts for the first time.
  6. For worked examples, show every step of the calculation process.
  7. After introducing a concept, include both the theoretical explanation and a practical application.
  8. End each lesson with a brief summary of the key points covered.

  Please create complete, thorough lessons that would be immediately ready for classroom use without further editing.
generatePractice: |
  Analyze the objective above and then:

  - Create a question that is a good practice question for the objective.
  - Make sure your question doesn't include tables, graphs or diagrams of any kind.
  -Reason through your solution before answering the question. Use code.
  - Answer the following:
    - What are the steps involved in solving this problem effectively? Demonstrate while solving the problem. Show all working. Do not skip any steps. I repeat, show *all* of your working.
    - If applicable, explain the reasoning behind using a specific mathematical operation or formula in each step.
  -   Are there any common misconceptions or pitfalls students should be aware of when answering this type of question? (e.g., order of operations, incorrect application of formulas, sign errors)

  - Also abide by the following editing notes
editingNotes: |
  - Ensure that the answer is correct and matches the solution provided. This is the most important rule.
  - Before responding, ensure the answer and the outcome of the solution have the same value. This is the second most important rule.
  - If the question has multiple parts, then separate each part to a separate list item on a new line. For example:
    ```
    <li> ... </li>
    <li> ... </li>
    <li> ... </li>
    ```
  - If the objective doesn't require decimals and fractions, then structure the questions so that only whole numbers are needed throughout every step of the solution and answer.
  - Escape \ in KaTeX syntax to prevent errors in JSON. For example, [tex]\frac{31}{10}[/tex] should become [tex]\\frac{31}{10}[/tex]
  - Take your time and give me the correct answers. I don't want to see anything like this: `Step 4: There must be a typo. The answer should be 21.`
  - Don't escape parentheses outside of [tex] or [texd] tags. I don't want to see anything like this: \(a\)
  - For equations that should be displayed on their own line, use [texd] instead of [tex] and wrap in equation environments:
    - Single line: [texd]\\begin{equation*} x + y = 5 \\end{equation*}[/texd]
    - Multiple lines: [texd]\\begin{equation*} \\begin{split} x + y &= 5 \\ y &= 5 - x \\end{split} \\end{equation*}[/texd]
    - Use & before = signs to align equations
    - Use \\ for line breaks in multi-line equations
  - Don't nest [tex] or [texd] tags. For example, don't do this: [tex][tex]x^2[/tex][/tex]

  - Keep inline equations (within text) using [tex] without environments
  - If a "section" property, for example, `"section": 9` is present, return it as is

  - For money within [tex] or [texd] tags, use \\$ instead of $. Outside of [tex] or [texd] tags, use $ for money.
  - Write for a grade-8 reading level. Don't sound like you're speaking to children. Get straight to the point in a conversational tone.
  - Make the tone conversational. For example:
      - "In step 2, we use the distributive property because..."
      - "The reason we use the Pythagorean theorem here is because..."

  - All answers must be of type 'string'.
  - All values must be in valid HTML syntax.
  - Round all decimals to 2 decimal places and indicate the same.

  - Don't wrap all plaintext math in parentheses like (x + y = 5).

  - For all mathematical steps (including in the new question, answer, solution, and notes if applicable), follow these instructions:
      - Use a separate line for each mathematical step.
      - Enclose inline math in [tex] tags and display math in [texd] tags
      - Use valid KaTeX notation for all expressions
      - Use proper equation environments for display math
      - Fractions should be written as `\\frac{a}{b}`
      - For vectors, use \overrightarrow instead of \vec.
      - For exponents, use '\\text{exp}^2'. For example, '[tex]\\text{cm}^2[/tex]' instead of 'square centimeters', cm2 or cm^2.
      - Another example: '3x^2 - 5y + z' should be '[tex]3x^{2} - 5y + z[/tex]  '
      - If you have any mathematical expression, wrap it in [tex] tags.
      - Don't use / for division. Use \\frac{a}{b} instead.
      - Dont use x for multiplication. Use \\times instead.

  - For solutions:
    - Each step should begin with an <h3> tag. Each heading should begin with the numbered step, for example <h3>Step 1: ...</h3>. 
    - All math in the heading should abide by the KaTeX syntax outlined in the editing notes.
    - Each advancement in the solution should be a new line.
    - Ensure that each sentence in the solution is started on a new line, so use a <p> tag for each sentence.

  - For notes:
    - Arrange each note in an ordered or unordered list (ul or ol) with children elements in <li> tags.
    - All math in the notes should abide by the KaTeX syntax outlined in the editing notes.
